### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, thanks for stopping by

I'm a passionate Software Development Engineer based in Cairo, Egypt, with a knack for optimizing performance and automating processes. I thrive on challenges and have a track record of contributing to large-scale projects, from boosting tool performance to developing innovative code generators.

Currently, I'm part of the dynamic team at eJad, where I've been instrumental in optimizing Automotive tools, building enterprise code generators, and managing project Infrastructure in a Scrum workflow.

#### ðŸ’» Skills
My technical arsenal includes Java, C++, Python, TypeScript, and a plethora of technologies such as Spring, Django, Qt, MySQL, MongoDB, and more. I am well-versed in various methodologies, including Agile, and have hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines.

#### ðŸ“š Publications
I've also dabbled in academic contributions, with a publication on "Neural Machine Based Mobile Applications Code Translation" presented at the 2020 Novel Intelligent and Leading Emerging Sciences Conference (NILES).
